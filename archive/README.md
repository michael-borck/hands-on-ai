# AiLabKit Archive

This directory contains archived scripts and utilities that were used during the migration from ChatCraft to AiLabKit or for other one-time tasks. These files are kept for historical reference and are generally not needed for regular development.

## Directory Structure

- **`archive/`**: Contains migration scripts used for the transition from ChatCraft to AiLabKit

## Note on Usage

The files in this directory are not actively maintained and may not work with the current project structure. They are provided for reference only.

For current development tools, please use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory instead.

If you need to perform similar tasks, consider adapting these scripts or creating new ones based on the templates in the scripts directory.
