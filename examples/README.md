# Hands-On AI Examples

This directory contains example scripts that demonstrate how to use the Hands-On AI package. These examples show different features and use cases to help you get started with the library.

## Basic Examples

- **`simple_weather_agent_test.py`**: A basic example showing how to create an agent with weather-related tools
- **`test_agent.py`**: Demonstrates the agent functionality with multiple tools and format detection
- **`weather_graph_agent_example.py`**: Shows how to use graph-generating tools with the agent

## Advanced Examples

- **`debug_agent_prompt.py`**: Helps debug issues with agent prompts and tool calling
- **`debug_json_agent.py`**: Demonstrates the JSON-based agent format for debugging
- **`enhanced_test_agent.py`**: Shows enhanced agent capabilities with multiple formats
- **`json_agent.py`**: Example implementation of a pure JSON-based agent
- **`multi_format_agent_test.py`**: Tests both ReAct and JSON formats with various models

## Running the Examples

You can run any example script directly from this directory:

```bash
python examples/test_agent.py
```

Make sure you have Ollama running and appropriate models installed before running the examples.
