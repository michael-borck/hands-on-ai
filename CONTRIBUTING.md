- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
- Add comments for complex or non-obvious code sections.
- Keep lines to a maximum of 88 characters.

## Adding a New Bot Personality

To add a new bot personality:

1. Open `__init__.py` in the main package.
2. Add a new function for your bot, following the existing pattern:
   ```python
   def your_bot_name(prompt):
       return get_response(
           prompt, 
           system="Your system prompt here.", 
           personality="your_personality_name"
       )
   ```
3. Add your bot to the `__all__` list.
4. Add appropriate fallback messages in `data/fallback.jsom`.
5. Document your bot in the README.md and other relevant documentation.

## Adding Documentation

If you're adding documentation:

1. Place general documentation in the `docs/` directory.
2. Ensure educational materials are appropriate for classroom use.
3. Include clear examples and explanations.
4. Specify the target audience (grade level, experience level).

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Test your code with multiple inputs.
2. Ensure it works with the default Ollama backend.
3. Check for any error conditions or edge cases.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md and documentation with details of changes if applicable.
2. Update the version number following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
3. Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers who may request changes.
4. Once approved, your pull request will be merged.


## üß∞ Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dev dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
   Or if you're using Poetry-compatible tools:
   ```bash
   pip install .[dev]
   ```

## üîß Common Commands

Use either `just <task>` or `make <task>`:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `test` | Run tests using pytest |
| `lint` | Lint code with Ruff |
| `format` | Auto-format with Ruff |
| `build` | Build the Python package |
| `bundle` | Create offline zip of project_browser |
| `sync-version` | Sync version across HTML and TOML |
| `docs` | Build static site with MkDocs |
| `deploy-docs` | Deploy to GitHub Pages |

## ü§ñ Bot Contributions

To add a new bot:
1. Define the function in `chatcraft/__init__.py`
2. Follow the pattern: `def <name>_bot(prompt): ...`
3. Include a meaningful docstring with:
   - Usage example
   - Educational uses
   - Example response
4. Add an entry to `fallbacks.json` (optional)

## üß™ Testing
Add your tests in `tests/`. For bots, test both:
- Basic output (non-empty)
