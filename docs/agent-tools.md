- **Output**: Prime status, factors (if not prime), and nearest prime numbers

## Date and Time Tools

Tools for working with dates and time calculations.

### Date Difference Calculator

Calculates the time span between two dates.

- **Name**: `date_diff`
- **Description**: Calculate the difference between two dates
- **Example Input**: Two dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Output**: Time span in years, months, days, and total days

### Date Formatter

Converts dates to different formats.

- **Name**: `format_date`
- **Description**: Format a date in different styles
- **Example Input**: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Parameters**: Format code (iso, short, medium, long, full)
- **Output**: Date in the requested format

### Days Until Calculator

Calculates days until a future date.

- **Name**: `days_until`
- **Description**: Calculate days until a specific date
- **Example Input**: Target date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Output**: Time remaining until the target date

## Dictionary Tools

Tools for language and vocabulary assistance.

### Word Lookup

Provides definitions and examples for words.

- **Name**: `define`
- **Description**: Look up the definition of a word
- **Example Input**: Any English word
- **Output**: Word definitions, part of speech, and usage examples

### Synonym Finder

Finds synonyms for a given word.

- **Name**: `synonyms`
- **Description**: Find synonyms for a word
- **Example Input**: Any English word
- **Output**: List of synonyms with similar meanings

## Unit Conversion Tools

Tools for converting between different units of measurement.

### Temperature Converter

- **Example Input**: Value and source/target units
- **Output**: Converted weight value

## Using Tools in AiLabKit

Agents can use these tools to assist with tasks by following a reasoning process:

1. The agent receives a question or task from the user
2. The agent thinks about what tools might help solve the problem
3. The agent calls one or more tools with appropriate inputs
4. The agent uses the tool results to formulate a response

### Example Usage

```python
from ailabkit.agent import run_agent

# Ask a question that requires tool use
response = run_agent("What is the atomic weight of oxygen and what is 25 Ã— 16?")

# The agent might use the periodic_table tool for the element info
# and the calculator tool for the multiplication
print(response)
```

### Command Line Usage

Tools can also be accessed via the command line:

```bash
# List all available tools
agent tools

# Ask the agent a question that requires tool use
agent ask "How many days until December 25, 2023?"
```
