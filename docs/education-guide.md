# AiLabKit: Education Guide

> "LLMs made simple for students and educators"

This guide provides educational rationale, classroom implementation strategies, and learning objectives for using AiLabKit in various educational settings.

## Educational Value

ChatCraft was designed with specific educational benefits in mind:

1. **Removing Technical Barriers** - Students can experiment with AI without getting lost in API keys, tokens, or complex setup
2. **Focusing on Core Programming Concepts** - Function calls, variables, conditionals, and user input are reinforced
3. **Encouraging Creative Expression** - Personality bots invite students to think about tone, voice, and creative writing
4. **Making AI Approachable** - Simplifies complex technology into manageable, fun interactions
5. **Building Critical AI Literacy** - Students learn about AI capabilities and limitations through hands-on experimentation

## Curriculum Integration

ChatCraft can be integrated into various levels of computer science education:

### Beginner Level (No Prior Programming Experience)
- **Objectives**: Basic syntax, function calls, variables
- **Activities**: 
  - Modify existing bot personalities
  - Create simple conversation scripts
  - Experiment with different prompts

### Intermediate Level (Some Programming Experience)
- **Objectives**: Conditionals, loops, functions, error handling
- **Activities**: 
  - Create custom bot personalities from scratch
  - Build a menu-based chatbot interface
  - Develop a simple Q&A system

### Advanced Level (Proficient in Python)
- **Objectives**: API integration, state management, more complex applications
- **Activities**: 
  - Create multi-bot conversation simulations
  - Build a chatbot with memory/context
  - Extend ChatCraft with additional backends

## Classroom Implementation Models

### 1. Guided Tour (1 Hour)
A quick introduction to AI concepts through ChatCraft:
- 10 min: Introduction to LLMs and ChatCraft
- 15 min: Demonstration of pre-built bots
- 25 min: Hands-on with simple modifications
- 10 min: Discussion and reflection

### 2. Mini-Project Workshop (2-3 Hours)
Students build a specific application with ChatCraft:
- 15 min: Introduction and demo
- 30 min: Planning and design
- 90 min: Development time
- 15 min: Showcase and sharing

### 3. Multi-Week Unit (2-3 Weeks)
Deeper exploration of AI concepts and applications:
- Week 1: Introduction to ChatCraft and basic interactions
- Week 2: Building custom personalities and applications
- Week 3: Culminating projects and presentations

## Learning Objectives by Domain

### Computer Science
- Understand function calls and parameters
- Practice string manipulation and text processing
- Implement basic control structures
- Gain exposure to API concepts

### AI Literacy
- Recognise capabilities and limitations of LLMs
- Understand the role of system prompts in shaping responses
- Identify patterns in AI-generated content
- Develop critical thinking about AI outputs

### Creativity & Communication
- Design unique bot personalities
- Craft effective prompts for desired outcomes
- Create narrative-based interactions
- Express ideas through multiple communication styles

## Assessment Ideas

- **Portfolio**: Collection of bot personalities created by students
- **Project**: Functional application built with ChatCraft (quiz bot, story bot, etc.)
- **Reflection**: Written analysis of AI strengths/limitations observed
- **Presentation**: Demo of custom bot and explanation of design choices

## Classroom Setup Requirements

### Hardware
- Standard classroom computers or laptops
- Internet connection (if using remote LLM APIs)
- Or: Sufficient local processing power for running Ollama locally

### Software
- Python 3.6+
- ChatCraft library installed
- Ollama or alternative LLM backend

### Preparation Steps
1. Install Python on all classroom machines
2. Install ChatCraft (`pip install chatcraft`)
3. Set up Ollama with desired models (llama3 recommended for beginners)
4. Test a basic example before class

## Ethical Considerations

When introducing AI in the classroom, consider discussing:

- **Attribution**: When is AI-generated content appropriate to use?
- **Transparency**: The importance of disclosing when AI has been used
- **Critical evaluation**: Not accepting AI outputs without verification
- **Appropriate uses**: Setting boundaries for how the tool should be used

## Example Lesson Plan: "Personality Bot Workshop"

**Duration**: 90 minutes
**Level**: Beginner to Intermediate
**Objective**: Students will create and interact with custom personality bots

### Materials
- Computers with Python and ChatCraft installed
- Handout with personality prompt examples
- Worksheet for planning bot personalities

### Lesson Flow

1. **Introduction (15 min)**
   - Demonstrate existing personality bots
   - Explain the concept of system prompts
   - Show how personality affects responses

2. **Planning Phase (15 min)**
   - Students brainstorm bot personalities
   - Complete worksheet defining tone, style, quirks
   - Share ideas with a partner for feedback

3. **Implementation (30 min)**
   - Code their personality bot function
   - Test with various prompts
   - Refine system prompts based on results

4. **Challenge Extension (15 min)**
   - Create a conversation between two different bots
   - Implement a simple menu to switch between bots

5. **Showcase & Reflection (15 min)**
   - Students demonstrate their bots
   - Class votes on most creative, most helpful, most amusing bots
   - Discussion: What did you learn about how system prompts affect responses?

### Assessment
- Completed personality bot function
- Creative application of system prompts
- Thoughtful reflection on bot behaviour
