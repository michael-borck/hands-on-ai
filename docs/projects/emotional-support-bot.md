def emotional_support_bot():
    print("=== Emotional Support Bot ===")
    print("This bot will respond differently based on how you're feeling.")
    print("Type 'exit' at any time to quit.\n")
    
    # Define different bot personalities for different moods
    def therapist_bot(prompt):
        return get_response(
            prompt,
            system="You are a compassionate and empathetic therapist. Provide supportive, thoughtful responses that validate the user's feelings. Offer gentle guidance and perspective without being pushy. Keep responses brief and focused on emotional support."
        )

# Run the emotional support bot
if __name__ == "__main__":
    emotional_support_bot()
```

### Extension Ideas

- Add more emotional states and corresponding bot personalities
- Create a mood tracking feature that remembers past interactions
- Implement sentiment analysis to detect mood from user's free text input
- Create a guided meditation or breathing exercise option
- Allow users to rate how helpful the responses were to improve the bot
