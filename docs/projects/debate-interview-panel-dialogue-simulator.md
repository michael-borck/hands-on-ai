## AI Persona Dialogue Simulator

**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Time**: 45-60 minutes  
**Learning Focus**: Function calls, lists, creativity, dialogue simulation

### Overview

Simulate interactive dialogues between multiple AI personas with different personalities or perspectives. This flexible tool enables both multi-participant panel discussions and focused one-on-one debates, allowing students to explore how different characters approach the same topics. The simulator can also be configured to run simulated interviews by selecting appropriate personas and question formats.

Simulate an interview or debate between multiple bots with different personalities or perspectives, exploring how different characters might approach the same questions or topics.

This project offers flexibility to run either panel discussions with multiple participants or focused one-on-one debates, allowing students to explore how different personas respond to the same topics.

    Simulate a dialogue between multiple AI personas with different personalities,

    This tool supports multiple dialogue formats:
    1. Panel discussion - Multiple personas exchange views with less structure
    2. Formal debate - Two personas engage in structured argument with multiple rounds
    3. Interview - One persona can be set as an "interviewer" asking questions 
       of other personas serving as "interviewees"

### Using the Simulator for Interviews

To use this simulator specifically for interview scenarios:

1. **Select Format #3 (Interview)** - This configures one persona to act as the interviewer and others as interviewees

2. **Choose the Interviewer** - Select the "Interviewer" persona (option #8) for best results, though any persona can serve as an interviewer

3. **Select Interviewees** - Choose which personas will be interviewed on the selected topic

4. **Set Number of Questions** - Determine how many rounds of questions the interviewer will ask

5. **Interview Structure:**
   - The interviewer begins with an opening question about the topic
   - Each interviewee responds from their unique perspective
   - The interviewer asks follow-up questions in subsequent rounds
   - The session concludes with a wrap-up from the interviewer and final thoughts from interviewees

This interview format is particularly useful for:
- Exploring multiple perspectives on controversial topics
- Demonstrating how different personality types respond to the same questions
- Simulating talk show or panel interview dynamics
- Teaching questioning techniques and response patterns

### Extension Ideas

- Add a feature for the user to join as an additional participant
- Create specialized formats for specific topics (ethics, technology, etc.)
- Implement a scoring system where users rate which perspective they found most compelling
- Add follow-up questions that challenge each persona's perspective
- Create a "change my mind" feature where personas try to persuade on a controversial topic
- Allow students to create their own custom persona profiles
- Add a feature to visualize the dialogue flow and connections between arguments
- Implement a fact-checker persona that evaluates claims made during discussions
- Create a mode where personas can switch perspectives mid-dialogue to show flexibility in thinking
- Add the ability to save transcripts for later analysis or comparison
