```python
from chatcraft import get_response

def personality_menu():
    print("=== Bot Personality Menu Generator ===")
    print("Interact with various bot personalities!")
    print("Type 'exit' at any time to quit.\n")
    
    # Define different bot personalities

        return get_response(
            prompt,
            system="You are a friendly, helpful assistant who is always positive and encouraging. You use warm language and provide supportive responses."

    def emoji_bot(prompt):
        return get_response(
            prompt,
            system="You are an emoji enthusiast who includes multiple relevant emojis in every response. Your tone is upbeat and playful. Make sure to use at least 3-5 emojis in each message."
        )

        print("\nType 'menu' to switch bots or 'exit' to quit")

# Run the personality menu
if __name__ == "__main__":
    personality_menu()
```

## Extension Ideas

- Allow users to create and save their own custom bot personalities
- Add a "random" option that selects a personality at random
- Create a rating system where users can score responses
- Implement a "conversation history" feature that remembers past interactions
- Create themed conversation scenarios for different bot personalities
