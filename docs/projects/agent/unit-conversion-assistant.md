# Unit Conversion Assistant

**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Learning Focus**: Conversion tools, formatting responses  
**Module**: agent

## Overview
Build a helpful unit conversion assistant that can convert between different measurement systems.

## Instructions
1. Launch the agent using `ailabkit agent interactive`
2. Explore the different conversion tools by asking the agent about them
3. Test basic conversions like "Convert 5 miles to kilometers" or "How many kilograms is 150 pounds?"
4. Try more complex queries like "If my recipe needs 350g of flour but I only have a cup measure, how much should I use?"
5. Create a travel scenario where you need to convert temperatures, distances, and weights
6. Document how the agent selects the appropriate conversion tool for each query

## Extension Ideas
- Ask for conversions between multiple units in a single question
- Create a cooking recipe that uses mixed measurement systems and ask the agent to standardize it
- Challenge the agent with historical units like leagues, stones, or furlongs
