## Overview
Create a date calculator that helps plan projects, calculate age, and work with calendar-based information.

## Instructions
1. Start the agent in interactive mode using `ailabkit agent interactive`
2. Explore the date tools by asking questions like:
   - "How many days until Christmas?"
   - "What's the difference between March 15, 2023 and today?"
   - "How old would someone be if they were born on July 4, 1990?"
3. Create a project timeline with 3-4 milestones and ask the agent to calculate the duration between them
4. Ask the agent to format dates in different styles (short, long, with weekday, etc.)
5. Document which queries worked well and which required more specific instructions

## Extension Ideas
- Create a birthday calculator that tells you interesting facts about your birth date
- Plan an international trip across different time zones and ask the agent for help
- Ask about historical date calculations, like "How many days passed between the moon landing and the fall of the Berlin Wall?"
