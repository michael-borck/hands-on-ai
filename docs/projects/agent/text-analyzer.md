## Overview
Build a text analysis tool that helps evaluate and improve writing by providing metrics and suggestions.

## Instructions
1. Start the agent using `ailabkit agent interactive`
2. Write a short paragraph (5-7 sentences) on a topic of your choice
3. Ask the agent to analyze your text using the word_count tool
4. Request a readability analysis of your paragraph
5. Ask the agent to summarize your text and compare it to your original
6. Based on the analysis, ask for specific suggestions to improve:
   - Sentence length variation
   - Vocabulary diversity
   - Overall readability
7. Revise your paragraph and run the analysis again to see the changes

## Extension Ideas
- Analyze different types of writing (technical, creative, persuasive) and compare the metrics
- Ask the agent to help you rewrite the same content for different audiences (children, experts, general public)
- Create a writing improvement workflow that uses multiple text analysis tools in sequence
