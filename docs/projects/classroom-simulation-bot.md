# Classroom Simulation Bot

**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Time**: 45-60 minutes  
**Learning Focus**: Functions, menu systems, multiple bot use

## Overview

Create a classroom simulation where students can interact with different characters or experts on various topics, practicing both coding skills and exploring different perspectives.

## Instructions

```python
from chatcraft import get_response

def classroom_simulation():
    print("=== Virtual Classroom Simulation ===")
    print("Ask questions to different characters about any topic!")
    print("Type 'exit' at any time to quit.\n")
    
    # Define different bot personalities
    def teacher_bot(prompt):
        return get_response(
            prompt,
            system="You are a knowledgeable, patient teacher who explains concepts clearly with examples. You encourage critical thinking and use analogies to simplify complex ideas. Keep explanations concise but thorough."
        )
    
    def hacker_bot(prompt):
        return get_response(
            prompt,
            system="You are an ethical hacker with expertise in cybersecurity. You explain technical concepts with a slightly rebellious attitude but always emphasize ethical practices and security. Never provide instructions for illegal activities. Use technical terminology but explain it."
        )
    
    def pirate_bot(prompt):
        return get_response(
            prompt,
            system="You are a pirate captain from the Golden Age of Piracy. You speak with pirate slang and terminology (arr, matey, etc.). Despite your rough manner, you're surprisingly knowledgeable about navigation, history, and seafaring. Keep responses brief and entertaining."
        )
    
    def scientist_bot(prompt):
        return get_response(
            prompt,
            system="You are a brilliant scientist who is excited about all fields of science. You explain scientific concepts with enthusiasm and wonder, citing relevant research and discoveries. You are factual and precise but can make complex ideas accessible."
        )
    
    # Display available characters
    def show_menu():
        print("\n=== Available Characters ===")
        print("1. Teacher - Clear explanations and educational guidance")
        print("2. Hacker - Cybersecurity and tech knowledge with attitude")

                response = bot(question)
                print(response)
            else:
                print("Please answer 'yes' or 'no'.")

# Run the classroom simulation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    classroom_simulation()
```

## Extension Ideas

- Add more character types like historian, artist, or fictional character
- Create a debate mode where two characters discuss the same topic
- Add a quiz feature where characters test the user's knowledge
- Create a storyline or scenario that involves multiple characters
- Allow characters to "remember" previous interactions in the session
