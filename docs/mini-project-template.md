I need a python script to modify all markdown file in a folder from the current format to the new format.

The instructions also contain python code with comments, so we do not want to modify the comments in the python code.  the python code is gated "```python" and "```"

The current format is as follows:

```markdown
## Project Title

**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Learning Focus**: Lists, loops, user input

### Overview
A short description of what the student will build or learn.

### Instructions
Step-by-step or scaffolded guidance.

### Extension Ideas
Optional: Ways to expand or personalize the project.
```

The new format is as follows:

```markdown
# Project Title

**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Learning Focus**: Lists, loops, user input

## Overview
A short description of what the student will build or learn.

## Instructions

## Extension Ideas
