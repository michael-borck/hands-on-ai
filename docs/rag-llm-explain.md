# 🤖 What Does the LLM Do in RAG?

You might wonder:

> “If we already found the answer in the document, why do we need a language model?”

Let’s break it down with a real example 👇

---

## 📦 You Ask a Question

```
Q: What are the benefits of TCP?
```

---

## 🔍 Retriever Finds a Chunk

```
📄 Retrieved:
"TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery,
error checking, and congestion control."
```

---

## 🤖 The LLM Thinks...

It takes that chunk and your question, and:

- Rephrases  
- Summarizes  
- Explains clearly

---

## 💬 LLM Responds

```
A: TCP is more reliable than other protocols because it guarantees your data will arrive in order and without errors. This is especially useful for web browsing and email.
```

## 🧠 Why Use an LLM at All?

| Retriever 📚        | LLM 🤖                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Finds relevant info | Turns it into a helpful answer |
| Keyword matching    | Language understanding         |
| Memory              | Reasoning                      |

You need **both** to make RAG powerful.
