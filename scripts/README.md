# AiLabKit Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts used for development, maintenance, and building AiLabKit.

## Mini-Projects Scripts

- **`split_mini_projects.py`**: Splits a markdown file with level-1 headers into individual project files
  - Usage: `./split_mini_projects.py --input docs/projects/mini-projects.md --output-dir docs/projects/`

## Notes

These scripts are primarily intended for maintainers and contributors. Users of AiLabKit generally do not need to run these scripts directly.

For documentation on using AiLabKit, please refer to the docs/ directory or the official documentation website.
